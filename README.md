# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an app to help travelers plan their trips. First, I used API's to retreive the weather data of cities around the world. With this weather data, I asked the user for their temperature preferences and narrowed down the dataset to reflect this choice. I created a map of all the preferred cities with markers to indicate the hotels of the cities. Finally, I created a travel route between different cities of a country within the preferred cities dataframe.
